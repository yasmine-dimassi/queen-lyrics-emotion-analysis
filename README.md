# Emotion analysis of Queen's lyrics

This repository contains a detailed notebook on the analysis of the lyrics of all Queen's song which is a famous rock band formed in London back in the 70s if you didn't already knew that. 

• The first part contains the web scraping of a lyrics website 

• The second part is about text mining that will help us analyse our data previously scraped. It is divided into three main parts : data description, data cleaning and data analysis.

PS: In case you don't want to execute the webscraping part, I have included the scraped_lyrics.csv file.
