# Emotion analysis of Queen's lyrics

This repository contains a well detailed jupyter notebook, for beginners in text mining techniques, about the analysis of all Queen's songs lyrics, which is a famous rock band formed in London back in the 70s.

• The first part contains the web scraping of a lyrics website.

• The second part is text mining that will help us analyse our previously scraped data. It is divided into three main parts : data description, data cleaning and data analysis.


PS: In case you don't want to execute the webscraping part, I have included the scraped_lyrics.csv file.
