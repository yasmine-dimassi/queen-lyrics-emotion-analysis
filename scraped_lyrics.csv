jealousy,  Oh how wrong can you be?  Oh to fall in love was my very first mistake  How was I to know I was far too much in love to see?  Oh jealousy look at me now  Jealousy you got me somehow  You gave me no warning  Took me by surprise  Jealousy you led me on  You couldn't lose you couldn't fail  You had suspicion on my trail    How how how all my jealousy  I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride  Now I'm only left with my own jealousy    Oh how strong can you be  With matters of the heart?  Life is much too short  To while away with tears  If only you could see just what you do to me  Oh jealousy you tripped me up  Jealousy you brought me down  You bring me sorrow you cause me pain  Jealousy when will you let go?  Gotta hold of my possessive mind  Turned me into a jealous kind    How how how all my jealousy  I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride  Now I'm only left with my own jealousy  But now it matters not if I should live or die  'Cause I'm only left with my own jealousy

inonlysevendays,  Monday   Start of my holiday.  Freedom for just one week.  Feels good to get away.    Tuesday   Saw her down on the beach.  I stood and watched a while   And she looked and smiled at me.    Wednesday   I didn't see her.  I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow.    And then on Thursday  My luck had changed.  She stood there all alone   I went and asked her name.    I never thought that this could happen to me  In only seven days.  It would take a hundred or more  For memories to fade.    I wish Friday would last forever.  I held her close to me.  I couldn't bear to leave her there.    Saturday  just twenty four hours.  Oh  no  I'm going back home on Sunday.    I'm so sad alone.

Chippin' around  kick my brains 'round the floor.  These are the days: it never rains but it pours.    People on streets.  People on streets.    It's the terror of knowing  What this world is about.

We are fighting for peace  no regard for the time.  We never cry  we never retreat.  We have no conception of love or defeat.    What's that machine noise?  It's bytes and mega chips for tea.  It's that machine  boys  With random-access memory.    Never worry  never mind.  Not for money  not for gold.

isthistheworldwecreated,  Just look at all those hungry mouths we have to feed  Take a look at all the suffering we breed  So many lonely faces scattered all around  Searching for what they need.    Is this the world we created?  What did we do it for?  Is this the world we invaded  Against the law?  So it seems in the end.  Is this what we're all living for today?  The world that we created.    You know that everyday a helpless child is born  Who needs some loving care inside a happy home  Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne  Waiting for life to go by.    Is this the world we created?  We made it on our own.  Is this the world we devastated  Right to the bone?    If there's a God in the sky looking down   What can he think of what we've done  To the world that He created?

Everybody knows:  One day we love each other  Then we're fighting one another  All the time.    When I was young and just getting started   And people talked to me: they sounded broken hearted.  Then I grew up and got my imagination   And all I wanted was to start a new relation.    So in love  but love had a bad reaction.  I was looking for some good old satisfaction   But pain is all I got  When all I needed was some love and affection.    Pain is so close to pleasure.  Sunshine and rainy weather  Go hand in hand together  All your life.    Pain and pleasure.  Pain and pleasure.    When your plans go wrong and you turn out the light   But inside of your mind you put up a fight.    Where are the answers that we're all searching for?  There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore.  Some days you're feeling good  some days you're feeling bad   But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad.    Let the sweetness of love wipe the tears from your face  For better  for worse.  So let's make the best of the rest of our years.    Pain is so close to pleasure.  I told you so.  Sunshine and rainy weather  Go hand in hand together  All your life.    Pain and pleasure.    Pain is so close to pleasure.  Sunshine and rainy weather  Go hand in hand together  All your life.    All your life.  Pain  pleasure.

Who dares to love forever  When love must die?    But touch my tears with your lips   Touch my world with your fingertips     And we can have forever   And we can love forever.  Forever is our today.    Who wants to live forever?  Who wants to live forever?  Forever is our today.    Who waits forever anyway?

thesearethedaysofourlives,  Sometimes I get to feeling  I was back in the old days long ago.  When we were kids  when we were young  Things seemed so perfect. You know?    The days were endless  we were crazy  we were young.  The sun was always shining. We just lived for fun.    Sometimes it seems like lately.  I just don't know.  The rest of my life's been just a show.    Those were the days of our lives.  The bad things in life were so few.  Those days are all gone now   But one thing is true  When I look and I find I still love you.    You can't turn back the clock   You can't turn back the tide.  Ain't that a shame?  I'd like to go back one time on a roller-coaster ride  When life was just a game.    No use sitting and thinking on what you did  When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids.    Sometimes it seems like lately.  I just don't know  Better sit back and go with the flow    'Cause these are the days of our lives.  They've flown in the swiftness of time.  These days are all gone now   But some things remain  When I look and I find no change.    Those were the days of our lives.  The bad things in life were so few.  Those days are all gone now   But one thing's still true  When I look and I find I still love you.    I still love you.

Inside my heart is breaking.  My make-up may be flaking.  But my smile still stays on.    Whatever happens   I'll leave it all to chance.  Another heartache   Another failed romance.    On and on.  Does anybody know what we are living for?    I guess I'm learning.  I must be warmer now.  I'll soon be turning  'Round the corner now.    Outside the dawn is breaking   But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free.    Show must go on.  Show must go on.  Inside my heart is breaking.  My make-up may be flaking   But my smile still stays on.    My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies.  Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die.  I can fly  my friends.    Show must go on.  Show must go on.  I'll face it with a grin.  I'm never giving inxe2x80x94  Ohxe2x80x94with the show.    I'll top the bill   I'll overkill.

No  there's no making sense of it  Every way I go I'm bound to lose    Too much love will kill you  Just as sure as none at all.  It'll drain the power that's in you  Make you plead and scream and crawl  And the pain will make you crazy  You're the victim of your crime  Too much love will kill you every time    Too much love will kill you  It'll make your life a lie  Yes  too much love will kill you  And you won't understand why  You'd give your life  you'd sell your soul  But here it comes again  Too much love will kill you  In the end...  In the end.

webelieve,  I believe there's no evil out there we didn't have a hand in    You believe it's a time for peace and a time for understanding    Some of us believe that we are chosen    And if God is on our side we'll win the game    And some of us believe that there's a heaven    When the trumpets sound and the judges call your name    But let's get it straight:       I believe there's just once chance in this world to hear our brothers    You believe there's a better way to listen to each other    We don't get what the other guy is saying    We hear the words but we don't understand    So around the world the same old anger raging    And we all cry for shame and the same old tragedy goes down       We believe there's a better way to fight    There's a way to make our children safe at night    We believe there's a war we could be winning    But the only way to win it is to give what we need to receive       I believe we need a hero to step boldly from the shadows    You believe there must be someone on the scene that fits the bill    A man or a woman who knows how to say I'm sorry    With courage in his heart to match his creed    A leader who can build a brand new morning    And match the tide of changes    Match the intent with the deed       We believe there's a deed of obligation    To bring reconciliation    To make peace with every nation - in our time    We believe there's not a minute we should be wasting    When the darkness falls it's too late to fix the crime    It's peace that we need       Every father every mother knows the meaning    Human treasure that our leaders do forget    And the bullets fly in the face of common reason    And the pain we give is the legacy in the end we get       We believe there's a song that's worth the singing    It's a song of truth we're bringing    There's a way to share the Earth with everyone    We believe every creature has a being    Has a right to respect and feeling    To live and breathe and flourish in the sun       That's what we believe

Another tricky situation  I get to drownin' in the blues  And I find myself thinkin'  Well  what would you do?    Yes  it was such an operation  Forever paying every due  Hell  you made a sensation  You found a way through    One by one  Only the good die young  They're only flyin' too close to the sun  We'll remember  Forever...    And now the party must be over  I guess we'll never understand  The sense of your leaving  Was it the way it was planned?    And so we grace another table  And raise our glasses one more time  There's a face at the window  And I ain't never  never sayin' goodbye...    And it's one by one  Only the good die young  They're only flyin' too close to the sun  Cryin' for nothing  Cryin' for no-one  No-one but you
